        <p>Hi :)</p>
        <p>My name is Taylor.  I am a professional in the non-profit sector and a third generation Seattleite pivoting into a career that'll allow me to continue to live within the city limits. </p>

        <h2>Goals:</h2>
        <p>I want to make the internet a safer and more productive place for young people. Whether that is developing educational software and programs, making the arts more accessible online or keeping cyber creeps out of online spaces used by young people.  It is yet to be decided, but I certainly plan on figuring it out!</p>
